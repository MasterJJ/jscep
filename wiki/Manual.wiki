= About jSCEP =

This page will be used to capture the requirements of *all* jSCEP documentation from a user's point of view.

== Subprojects ==

 * api
 * client
 * server

== Requirements ==

 * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Java 5] 
 * [http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html Bouncy Castle Provider]
 * [http://commons.apache.org/codec/ Commons Codec]

== Roadmap ==

= Getting jSCEP =

 # Binary [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list Download]
 # Build from [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/source/checkout Subversion]
 # Maven (*not supported*)

== Binary Packages ==

See the [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list Downloads] tab

== Source Code ==

You can use jSCEP by compiling the source, or by downloading one of the [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list pre-compiled JARs].

=== Source Packages ===

We should offer source code packages.  See issue 8.

=== Building from Source

==== Prerequisites ====

To build, jSCEP from source, you'll need the following tools:

 * [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion]
 * [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]

{{{
user@host:~$ svn checkout http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jscep-read-only
user@host:~$ cd jscep-read-only
user@host:~/jscep-read-only$ mvn install
}}}

The above commands will check out the source code from the jSCEP subversion repository, followed by building each of the project artefacts and installing them into your local Maven repository.

== Quick Tour ==

This should be on the front page...
