This page describes how to add jSCEP to your own application.

= Details =

== Dependencies ==

jSCEP uses the [http://www.bouncycastle.org/ Bouncy Castle] JCE Provider library ("bcprov") for:

  * Generating X.509 Certificates
  * Generating PKCS #10 Certificate Signing Requests
  * Generating and Parsing ASN.1 Data

jSCEP uses the [http://www.bouncycastle.org/ Bouncy Castle] CMS library ("bcmail") for:

  * Generating and Parsing PKCS #7 Data

Both of these libraries can be downloaded from the [http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html latest releases] page on the Bouncy Castle web site.

=== Using the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider ===

You can use the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider in two ways:

  * adding the JAR to your classpath and calling Security.addProvider(...) in your application
  * putting the JAR into your $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory and configuring your JRE accordingly  

Both methods are covered by the [http://www.bouncycastle.org/specifications.html#install installation instructions] on the BC web site.

== Using jSCEP ==

Using jSCEP is *easy*:

  * download the [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list?q=label:Featured%20type=Library the latest release] of jSCEP
  * add the jSCEP and Bouncy Castle JARs to your classpath
