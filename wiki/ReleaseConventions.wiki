#summary Release Naming and SVN Branching Conventions
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This page discusses how releases will be named, and the layout of the jSCEP SVN repository.

= Release Naming Convention =

Whilst SCEP is still in Internet-Draft state, each release will use the following naming convention:

*jscep-0.<Internet-Draft Version>.<Last SVN Revision>*

So, if the current version of the Internet-Draft was 19, and the last SVN revision is 500, the release would be:

*jscep-0.19.500*

If and when SCEP enters the standards track the first number will be increased by 1 for each revision of the RFC, and the second number will be set to zero e.g.

*jscep-1.0.610*

= SVN Branching Convention =

The trunk of this project will always follow the latest Internet-Draft or -- if the SCEP specification enters the standards track -- RFC.  When each new specification is released, the trunk will be branched with the name of deprecated specification, so when [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nourse-scep-20 draft-nourse-scep-20] is released, the following path will be created:

*/branches/draft-nourse-scep-19*
