The following requests can be executed *outside* of a transaction:

=== Determining Server Capabilities ===

Calling [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/client/Client.html#getCaCapabilities() getCaCapabilities()] on the [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/client/Client.html Client] will yield a new [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/response/Capabilities.html Capabilities] instance, which provides information on the configuration of the SCEP server.  The available information includes:

  * Support for retrieval of a "rollover" CA certificate, if it exists.
  * Support for sending SCEP operations using HTTP POST
  * Support for renewing certificates
  * Support for the SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-256 hash algorithms.
  * Support for Triple-DES encryption.

{{{
client.getCaCapabilities();
}}}

=== Retrieve CA Certificate ===

{{{
client.getCaCertificate();
}}}

=== Retrieve Rollover CA Certificate ===

When a CA rolls over to a new certificate, it may choose to indicate this state change through its SCEP capabilities.  In such a case, [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/response/Capabilities.html#isRolloverSupported() Capabilities.isRolloverSupported()] will return `true`, and you are free to retrieve the certificate like so:

{{{
if (client.getCaCapabilities().isRolloverSupported()) {
    client.getRolloverCertificate();
}
}}}

When this method is invoked, jSCEP will check the server capabilities to ensure that roll-over is supported.  If roll-over is *not* supported, the method will through an !UnsupportedOperationException.
