The following requests can be executed *outside* of a transaction:

=== Determining Server Capabilities ===

Calling [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/client/Client.html#getCaCapabilities() getCaCapabilities()] on your client instance will yield a new [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/response/Capabilities.html Capabilities] instance, which provides information on the configuration of the SCEP server.  The following information can be retrieve from the capabilities instance:

  * if the server supports certificate rollover
  * if the server supports sending requests using HTTP POST
  * if the server supports renewal of certificates
  * the strongest hash algorithm supported by the server, out of:
    * MD5
    * SHA-1
    * SHA-256
    * SHA-512
  * the strongest cipher supported by the server, out of:
    * DES
    * Triple DES

=== Retrieve CA Certificate ===

{{{
client.getCaCertificate();
}}}

=== Retrieve Rollover CA Certificate ===

When a CA rolls over to a new certificate, it may choose to indicate this state change through its SCEP capabilities.  In such a case, [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/com/google/code/jscep/response/Capabilities.html#isRolloverSupported() Capabilities.isRolloverSupported()] will return `true`, and you are free to retrieve the certificate like so:

{{{
if (client.getCaCapabilities().isRolloverSupported()) {
    client.getRolloverCertificate();
}
}}}

When this method is invoked, jSCEP will check the server capabilities to ensure that roll-over is supported.  If roll-over is *not* supported, the method will throw an [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html UnsupportedOperationException].
