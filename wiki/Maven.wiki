 This page is for discussing how to add jSCEP to your own project using Maven.  For details     
 on how to _build_ jSCEP using Maven, see the [SourceCode source code] page.

There is currently no support for downloading jSCEP using Maven.  If we can get the artefact hosted, this will change.

Arrangements have been made with sonatype.  Next release should be made available through that.
