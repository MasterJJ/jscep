== File an Issue ==

Reporting bugs or requesting features.

== Write a Test ==

Especially if you have access to a SCEP-capable server.  It would be good to provide a simple tool to allow adopters to test out jSCEP against their particular server.

== Submit a Patch ==

If you've come across a problem, or can improve an area of jSCEP, please provide a patch (using `svn diff`) on the latest version of the branch you're interested in (including trunk).

== Become a Committer ==

If you'd like to become more involved in jSCEP, then you can apply to become a committer, and fix reported issues and implement requested features.

== Coding Standards ==
